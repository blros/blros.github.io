<h2 id="the-institute-for-digital-research-in-the-humanities-idrh"><a href="http://idrh.ku.edu">The Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities (IDRH)</a></h2>

<p>The IDRH was established in 2010 to provide resources and training in the practices and tools of the digital humanities, and to facilitate interdisciplinary academic collaborations and externally funded research. I have co-led the IDRH since it’s founding, working with a <a href="https://idrh.ku.edu/people">stellar cast</a> of co-directors, postdocs, students, and librarian and faculty colleagues across KU and beyond. (See a <a href="https://idrh.ku.edu/history">brief history of the IDRH here</a>.)</p>

<p>In addition to providing consultations and guidance on DH projects, and to offering workshops, classroom sessions, we have several significant initiatives, some of which are listed below.</p>

I served as Electronic Publishing Librarian at the SPO from it’s founding until I left Michigan in 2005. In this role I supported numerous publishing projects, small scale and large scale. Our team published over a dozen journals and scholarly digital projects, provided hosting for non-profit academic organizations’ subscription products, and developed a suite of services and that helped establish and sustain scholarly publications and expand the possibilities for library-based publishing.<br /><br />A selection of some of my favorite SPO projects are listed below.</p>
